**Discover careers aligned with your strengths, passions, and education.** 
 Powered by RIASEC Science and real-world job market data.

## Overview
SmartPath is an intelligent career recommender system designed to guide students, graduates, and job seekers toward ideal career paths aligned with their interests, skills, education and preferences. 

Built using machine learning and interactive visualizations, this tool empowers learners and job seekers to make informed, personalized data-driven career decisions.

Unlike generic career portals, SmartPath uses a hybrid similarity model to deliver actionable, custom-fit job recommendations, helping users identify their best-fit occupations and the skills they need to thrive.

## Core Features

Collects user input for:
- RIASEC interest scores (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional)
- Educational attainment
- Self-identified strong skills

Computes:
- Cosine similarity between user interests and occupational profiles
- Skill match scores based on user strengths
- Education compatibility

Outputs:
- Top 10 personalized career matches
- Skills match and education alignment
- CSV export + optional email delivery
- Summary visualization of recommendations

## Data Sources
SmartPath leverages curated occupational data from reliable public resources to ensure accuracy and relevance in career recommendations.  

| Dataset                    | Description                                                     | Source                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **O\*NET 27.0 Database**   | Occupational profiles with skills, RIASEC scores, and education | [O\*NET Database](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html)                      |
| **Interests Data**         | RIASEC distributions per job                                    | [O\*NET Interests](https://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/result/4.A.1.a.1)  |
| **Skills Importance**      | Importance ratings for 35+ skills per job                       | [O\*NET Skills](https://www.onetonline.org/skills/)                              |
| **Education Requirements** | Mapped typical education levels per occupation                  | [O\*NET Education](https://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/browse/Education/) |

The datasets were cleaned, transformed, and combined into a unified job profile format (job_profiles_clean.csv) used for real-time matching.

Cleaned data sample: `./data/job_profiles_clean.csv`

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Cosine Similarity (for recommender logic)

---
## Models & Recommendation Logic
The core of SmartPath is a **hybrid similarity model** that blends statistical scoring and machine learning to ensure highly personalized career recommendations.

- **Cosine Similarity**  
  Measures the angle between the user's RIASEC vector and each occupation's interest vector from O\*NET. Returns values from -1 (opposite) to 1 (perfect match).

- **Filtered Hybrid Similarity Score**  
  A final weighted score combining:  
  - RIASEC Cosine Similarity  
  - Skill Match Ratio (overlap of top 3 user skills vs. job-required skills)  
  - Education Level Compatibility (0 = mismatch, 1 = partial match, 2 = full match)

> These scores form the ranking backbone of our Top 10 career suggestions.

### Unsupervised Learning (Career Group Discovery)

Unsupervised learning was applied to find patterns and cluster jobs in the feature space. This supports **recommendation diversification** and enhances insight explainability.

- **KMeans Clustering** - Primary clustering algorithm for grouping jobs based on combined skill and interest profiles  
- **Agglomerative Clustering** - Built job similarity dendrograms for hierarchy understanding  
- **DBSCAN** - Identified niche job segments and outliers  
- **HDBSCAN** - Dynamic, noise-aware clustering for highly granular career paths

---

### Supervised Learning (Classification & Prediction)

Supervised ML was used to predict likely job clusters or roles based on labeled user profiles, improving the model's ability to validate and reinforce recommendations.

- **Logistic Regression** - Fast probabilistic classifier for early testing  
- **Random Forest** - Robust tree-based model for job path prediction  
- **XGBoost** - High-performing, interpretable model trained on cleaned and engineered user-job interaction data

---

## How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   - RIASEC scores (6-dim), top 3 skills, education level

2. **Similarity Engine**  
   - Cosine Similarity (RIASEC), Skill Match, Education Check

3. **Scoring & Filtering**  
   - Education filter applied, weighted score calculated

4. **Results Output**  
   - Top 10 job matches, skill/education gaps, CSV export, email option
